Data platform project

To define and run data pipelines with following tools:
- hetzner cloud server:
    - airflow to orchestrate dataflows
- Terraform & Terraform cloud
    - to set up infrastacture

**Note! This setup is not free, you are charged based on services above.**
Initial setup costs you roughly 8€ / month:
- 8€ / month to run server in hetzner

## Prerequisites
- [init Terraform](docs/systems/init_terraform.md)
- [init Github](docs/systems/init_github.md)
- [init hetzner](docs/systems/hetzner/init_hetzner.md)
- Python installed
- Create Python virtual environment, instructions [here](docs/create_venv.md)
- install repo in editable state, to get import references work, instruction [here](docs/init_project.md)

### Steps

- go to confs.py file and check that you have added necessary local environment variables, you can change the "RAW" types the name that you like
- run initialise.py from setup folder (Note! After this you resources are running and they are billable):
---creates terraform organization and workspace with required variables
---applies terraform resources
---copies ssh keys from hetzner server to local path (need for remote access to hetner server)
---create project folder in remote server
---clone repo in remote server
---create ssh keys in remote server

#### config remote ssh access
- once remote server is created, copy the ssh keys from remote server to your local computer [here](docs/systems/hetzner/remote_connection_hetzner.md)

- edit ssh config file and connect to server

#### set up github sync
- Everytime we push changes to main branch, we want to remote server be in sync with the latest changes
- remote access to hetzner server, and go to root users home directory (/root)
- create projects directory
```mkdir projects```
```cd projects```
- clone repository
```git clone <https path>```
- create SSH key
```ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096```
- add public key to authorized_keys file
```cat <path/to/public/key> >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys```
- copy content of private key
```cat <path/to/private/key>```
- go to github repo
    - settings > secrets > actions
- create the following repository secrets
----HETZ_SERVER_NAME
----HETZ_TOKEN
----MAIN_BRANCH
----SSH_HOST
----SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
----SSH_USER
----WORK_DIR







Next:
- Install Airflow to hetzner server, instructions [here](docs/systems/hetzner/init_airflow.md)
