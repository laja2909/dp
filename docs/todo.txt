CONTINUE WITH THE terrafrom api stuff, we can automate the organization creation and workspace creation!


#Problem:
--now that we have workflow in main branch. What about if we want to setup all resources again. If we now follow up the setup we need to merge our dev to main and then workflow stars which will fail!
----Need to do some logic so that all terraform stuff needs to be loaded first before running our workflow.
----Also in terraform setup we need to mkdir and clone the repo and all that stuff.
CONTINUE WITH README SETUP SET
ALSO THINK ABOUT CREATING GLOBAL CONFS FILE FOR ALL NECESSARY VARIABLES!


# airflow is now installed
--need to figure out how dags stuff
--also when closing ssh remote session, airflow webserver ui not work anymore in localhost:8080
---if want to access ui again, need to ssh remote and then run the port forward command again.
---How to solve this??




#DONE:
#git workflow
--Need to configure .github/workflows/main.yml file
---steps:
----get runner ip
----give temporary access to remote server for that ip
----do the ssh tricks
----remove the ip from the firewall
----if any errors occur in the workflow we need to remove the ip from the firewall settings still.

# Install airflow:
--Test kubernetes and helm chart installation (when installing kubernetes, check cpu usage of the hetzner server)
----This was not due to kubernetes and helm set up, this was due to vscode setting ~"search.symlink"
# finish documents
# toml file
# change name of the project
# Create TFCloud class and think about the functions and attributes there
# Create docs md of the remote connection
# Create proper key files and make sure to save them in proper folder (do it in separate py file)
# check that you have remote access now
# create manage_tf_cloud.py

#NOTES:
## You need to have correct indentityfile to access remotely in ssh:
---example this creates a connection: ssh root@159.69.35.153 -i .ssh-tf-hetzner-cloud/id_rsa.key
---and then in .ssh config file replace the identity file attribute with correct absolute path
